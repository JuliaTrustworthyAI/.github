# Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia

Taija is the organization that hosts software geared towards **T**rustworthy **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence in **J**uli**a**.

## 🏠 About 

Taija currently covers a range of approaches towards making AI systems more trustworthy:

- Model Explainability (`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`)
- Algorithmic Recourse (`CounterfactualExplanations.jl`, `AlgorithmicRecourseDynamics.jl`)
- Predictive Uncertainty Quantification (`ConformalPrediction.jl`, `LaplaceRedux.jl`)
- Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning (`LaplaceRedux.jl`)
- Hybrid Learning (`JointEnergyModels.jl`)

Various meta packages can be used to extend the core functionality:

- Plotting (`TaijaPlotting.jl`)
- Datasets for testing and benchmarking (`TaijaData.jl`)
- Interoperability with other programming languages (`TaijaInteroperability.jl`)

## 🔗 Related Software

Our packages are currently tailored towards the following larger package ecosystems for AI and machine learning in Julia:

- FluxML
- MLJ

Other external packages and ecosystems related to Trustworthy AI in Julia include:
