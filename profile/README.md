# Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia

Taija is the organization that hosts software geared towards **T**rustworthy **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence in **J**uli**a**.

## üè† About 

Taija currently covers a range of approaches towards making AI systems more trustworthy:

- Model Explainability ([CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl))
- Algorithmic Recourse ([CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl), [AlgorithmicRecourseDynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/AlgorithmicRecourseDynamics.jl))
- Predictive Uncertainty Quantification ([ConformalPrediction.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/ConformalPrediction.jl), [LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/LaplaceRedux.jl))
- Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning ([LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/LaplaceRedux.jl))
- Hybrid Learning ([JointEnergyModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/JointEnergyModels.jl))

Various meta packages can be used to extend the core functionality:

- Plotting ([TaijaPlotting.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaPlotting.jl))
- Datasets for testing and benchmarking ([TaijaData.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaData.jl))
- Interoperability with other programming languages ([TaijaInteroperability.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaInteroperability.jl))

## üîó Related Software

Our packages are currently tailored towards the following larger package ecosystems for AI and machine learning in Julia:

- [FluxML](https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/)
- [MLJ](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/)

Other external packages and ecosystems related to Trustworthy AI in Julia include:

- [Julia-XAI](https://github.com/Julia-XAI)
- [ShapML.jl](https://github.com/nredell/ShapML.jl)
