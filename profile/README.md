# Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia

Taija is the organization that hosts software geared towards **T**rustworthy **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence in **J**uli**a**.

## 🔁 Status

[@patalt](https://github.com/pat-alt): This project is still in its infancy. My goal is to collect various Julia packages geared towards Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in a single home. As a first step towards this goal, I intend to transfer various projects that I have been working on to this organization.

## 👐 Working on related projects?

Are you working on a Julia package that would fit well into this organization? Or do you perhaps have ideas for future projects? I’d love to hear about it, so please do get in touch!

Note: I’m still new to “GitHub Organizations”, so please bear with me. I would love for this to turn into an open and active organization bringing together Julia developers who are interested in promoting Trustworthy AI.

## 🐶 Taija?

Taija stands for **T**rustworthy **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence in **J**uli**a**. When thinking about a logo that embodies trustworthiness, I quickly landed on 🐶.
