# Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Julia

Taija is the organization that hosts software geared towards **T**rustworthy **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence in **J**uli**a**.

## üè† About 

Taija currently covers a range of approaches towards making AI systems more trustworthy:

- Model Explainability ([CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl))
- Algorithmic Recourse ([CounterfactualExplanations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/CounterfactualExplanations.jl), [AlgorithmicRecourseDynamics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/AlgorithmicRecourseDynamics.jl))
- Predictive Uncertainty Quantification ([ConformalPrediction.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/ConformalPrediction.jl), [LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/LaplaceRedux.jl))
- Effortless Bayesian Deep Learning ([LaplaceRedux.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/LaplaceRedux.jl))
- Hybrid Learning ([JointEnergyModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/JointEnergyModels.jl))

Various meta packages can be used to extend the core functionality:

- Plotting ([TaijaPlotting.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaPlotting.jl))
- Datasets for testing and benchmarking ([TaijaData.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaData.jl))
- Interoperability with other programming languages ([TaijaInteroperability.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTrustworthyAI/TaijaInteroperability.jl))

## üëê Contribute

We welcome contributions of any kind. If you want to get involved or use our software for or project, please feel free to reach out. If you have questions, comments or issues related to specific packages, please feel free to open issues or discussions on the respective repository.
